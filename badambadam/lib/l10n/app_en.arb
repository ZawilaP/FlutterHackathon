  "helloWorld": "Dear Parents,",
  "entryText": "We know that you have the best knowledge about your children. Most of your observations are about your children's skills and interests and are a reason for joy. However, there may be times when you could be concerned about your child's development. Then it is worth checking if there is indeed a reason for concern.\nWe give you the M-CHAT-R tool, which was created to assess the risk of autism spectrum. It allows for a preliminary assessment of the child in terms of his social development and communication skills. In most cases, if there are any developmental abnormalities, they only require visits to a speech therapist or simple exercises at home. Only a small percentage of the children examined require further diagnosis towards the autism spectrum. For these children, this is a chance for faster therapy.\nTherefore, we encourage you to complete the online questionnaire. Remember that it is always worth clarifying doubts so that nothing disrupts the adventure of exploring the world with our Little One.\nThe Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT-R), related materials, and all information about their possible use are available at https://www.mchatscreen.com.\nThe M-CHAT-R tool is intended for children aged 16 to 30 months. Completing the questionnaire for younger children will give false results, as they may not yet have mastered many skills that older children have. We encourage parents of younger children (between 12 and 18 months of age) to familiarize themselves with the list of developmental skills corresponding to this age: http://badabada.pl/dla-rodzicow/rozwoj-dziecka.",
